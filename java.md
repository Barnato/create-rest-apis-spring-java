# Java Program Structure

* Java is case sensitive.
* All Java programs are made of at least one class.
* The class name must match the file.
* Curly brackets {} mark the scope of the class.
* Every Java program has a method that is a sequence of tasks for the computer to execute.
* Statements perform single tasks. Objects are packages of state and behavior. They can represent real life objects like computers.
